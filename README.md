Our dataset:
Sleep Dataset
Our dataset is raw data from the Sleep Cycle iOS app from Northcube collected between 2014-2018. It describes the duration of sleep quality, mood after. In general we have around 900 samples.

Columns:
* When sleep started
* When sleep ended
* What is the quality of sleep
* What is the duration of sleep
* Sleep notes (drink coffee, drink tea, stressful day and other notes)
* What is the mood after sleep

Our goal is to test what factors and its combination influence on quality of sleep.(start of sleep and duration, sleeping notes, just duration of sleep)

Distribution of the data:
* Null Hypothesis * - duration of sleep doesn`t follow normal distribution.
Alternative hypothesis - duration of sleep follows normal distribution.

Dependency of data:
Null hypothesis - quality of the sleep does not depend on its duration and start of sleep.
Alternative hypothesis -quality of the sleep depends on its duration and start of sleep.
